how to trigger the event
2. what should happen when the event is triggered: a picnic blanket with a bee will appear
3. what the affected entities should do: when the bee is clicked close enough to flowers, you will earn points
4. what the new entity is and how it should behave: The bee is also controlled by the arrow keys, you get more points when you get close to flowers!
You aren't allowed to just sit on flowers and collect points, they will kick you off when you need to take a break!
You aren't allowed to fly offscreen either!
If you feel like there are no live flowers left because all the bears are eating them, don't worry! The gardener will use his A* pathing to replant them for you!
Get 20 points and you win!!!!
